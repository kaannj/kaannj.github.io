            <h2 class="about">About me.</h2>
            <h3>Since early <span class="emph">September 2022</span>
                I have been dedicating my free time off from school 
                and sports to get a jumpstart on my dream 
                to become a <span class="emph"> software engineer.</span>
            </h3>
            <h3>Ever since then, I've been watching as many videos and taking as many courses as I could on top of my
                school work to teach myself more about coding and <span class="emph">software development.</span>
            </h3>
            <h3>Currently, I am currenty attending Rowan University for a <span class="emph"> B.S. in computer science.</span>
                Out of college, I want to work diligently for start-ups and big tech corporations to be in the workforce
                of <span class="emph">innovative engineers that push the boundries of our society's possibilites.</span>

            <h2 class="title_caption">My Qualities.</h2>
            <h3>Coming from 10+ years of athletics such as soccer, swimming, and baseball I am a great team-worker and leader. 
                I love to interact and work alongside other like-minded people.
                I very firmly believe that <span class="emph">teamwork is the key to success.</span>
            </h3>
                
            <h3>I am proficient at teaching myself new skills and figuring out how to solve problems. So far, everything I know about coding
                such as <span class="emph">HTML, CSS, and Python,</span> is from teaching myself.
            </h3>
                
            <h3>Lastly, I believe that I am <span class="emph">down-to-earth.</span>
                I know there is always something new to be learned and everyone has something to teach you.
